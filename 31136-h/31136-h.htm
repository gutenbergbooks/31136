<h2>Distribution of Some Nebraskan Mammals</h2>

<p class="center">by<br /><br />

J. Knox Jones, Jr.</p>


<p>Because military service will interrupt my study of Nebraskan
mammals, I am here placing on record certain information on the
geographic distribution of several species&mdash;information that is
thought pertinent to current studies of some of my associates. Most
of this information is provided by specimens recently collected by
me and other representatives of the University of Kansas Museum
of Natural History, although specimens from other collections provide
some of the records herein reported. The other collections are
the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum
(USBS), the Hastings Museum (HM), the Nebraska Game,
Forestation and Parks Commission (NGFPC), the University of
California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), the University
of Michigan Museum of Zoology (MZ) and the University of Nebraska
State Museum (NSM). Grateful acknowledgment hereby
is made to persons in charge of these several collections for lending
the materials concerned. Specimens mentioned in the following accounts
are in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History,
except as otherwise stated. All measurements are in millimeters.
Color terms are those of Ridgway (1912). A part of the funds for
field work was made available by the National Science Foundation
and the Kansas University Endowment Association.</p>

<p><b>Sorex cinereus haydeni.</b> (Baird). <span class="smcap">Cinereous Shrew.</span>&mdash;Two male
shrews were trapped on April 7, 1952, among rocks along an old
railroad fill, 4 mi. N, 1/2 mi. E of Octavia, Butler County, thus extending
the known geographic range of <i>S. c. haydeni</i> approximately 60
miles southward from a line connecting Perch, Rock County, Nebraska,
with Wall Lake, Sac County, Iowa (see Jackson, 1928:52-53),
and providing the first record of occurrence in the Platte River Valley.
Two additional specimens, taken on July 17, 1952, are from
2-1/2 mi. N of Ord, Valley County, along the Loup River, a tributary
of the Platte from the north.</p>

<p><b>Blarina brevicauda carolinensis</b> (Bachman). <span class="smcap">Short-tailed
Shrew.</span>&mdash;J. S. Findley and I, in a forthcoming paper, review the distribution
of <i>Blarina brevicauda</i> in the Great Plains region, recording
<i>B. b. carolinensis</i> from the extreme southeastern and southwestern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
counties of Nebraska. A series of five shrews of this species recently
obtained from three miles south and two miles east of
Nebraska City in Otoe County, average significantly smaller in both
the cranial and the external measurements than typical <i>B. b. brevicauda</i>
and fall well within the range of <i>carolinensis</i>. Average and extreme
external measurements of the four adults from Otoe County,
three males and one female, are as follows: Total length, 110 (109-112);
length of tail-vertebrae, 24.2 (22-26); length of hind foot, 13.8
(13-14). Another specimen from 3 mi. S, 1-1/2 mi. E of Peru, Nemaha
County, also is referable to <i>carolinensis</i>. These recent records indicate
that the range of <i>B. b. carolinensis</i> extends up the Missouri
River Valley, approximately to Nebraska City, Otoe County. Five
specimens from Louisville, Cass County, the next county northward,
along the River, are referable to <i>B. b. brevicauda</i>.</p>

<p><b>Eptesicus fuscus fuscus.</b> (Beauvois). <span class="smcap">Big Brown Bat.</span>&mdash;One big
brown bat was obtained on July 23, 1952, from one mile west of
Niobrara, Knox County. While not so dark in dorsal coloration as
some specimens of <i>E. f. fuscus</i> from eastern Nebraska (Cass and
Sarpy counties), this specimen is noticeably darker than a series of
<i>E. f. pallidus</i> from Ft. Niobrara Wildlife Refuge, 4 mi. E of Valentine,
Cherry County, being near (16" <i>j</i>) Snuff Brown as opposed to
near (16' <i>i</i>) Buckthorn Brown. Previous to the taking of this specimen,
Webb and Jones (1952:277) reported as <i>E. f. pallidus</i> a specimen,
saved as a skull only, which was picked up dead at Niobrara.
It seems best to assign these two bats from the vicinity of Niobrara,
Knox County, to <i>E. f. fuscus</i>.</p>

<p><b>Sciurus carolinensis carolinensis</b> Gmelin. <span class="smcap">Gray Squirrel.</span>&mdash;An
adult male gray squirrel shot by Mr. Terry A. Vaughan in the
heavily timbered bluffs of the Missouri River, 3 mi. S, 2 mi. E of
Nebraska City, Otoe County, on October 10, 1953, provides the only
museum specimen of a gray squirrel from Nebraska known to me.
Residents in the area concerned report small numbers of this squirrel
as still occurring on the heavily wooded bluffs along the Missouri
River in Nemaha, Otoe and Richardson counties, Nebraska,
at least as far north as Nebraska City.</p>

<p>Gray squirrels from Nebraska have been reported twice before in
the literature as follows: "Mouth of Platte [River]" (Baird, 1858:262)
and Barada, Richardson County (Jones and Webb, 1949:312).
Swenk (1908:80), while listing no actual records, says of this squirrel,
"Common in the timber along watercourses of southeastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
Nebraska, but greatly outnumbered everywhere by [<i>Sciurus niger</i>]
<i>rufiventer</i>. I have no records west of the 97th meridian nor north
of the Platte."</p>

<p><b>Spermophilus franklinii</b> (Sabine). <span class="smcap">Franklin Ground Squirrel.</span>&mdash;A
specimen from 2 mi. NW of Lisco, in Morrill County (NSM
3324), extends the known geographic range of <i>S. franklinii</i> approximately
200 miles westward along the Platte River Valley from
Kearney, Buffalo County (see Howell, 1938:134), and suggests a
westward movement of this ground squirrel along the Platte River
in recent years.</p>

<p><b>Perognathus flavescens flavescens</b> Merriam. <span class="smcap">Plains Pocket
Mouse.</span>&mdash;<i>P. f. flavescens</i> occurs in the Sand Hills and adjacent
mixed-grass plains of central Nebraska. Eastern marginal records
of occurrence are: Neligh, Antelope County, 2 (MVZ 1, NSM 1);
1 mi. E of Ravenna, Buffalo County, 2 (MZ); unspecified locality
in Adams County, 1 (HM).</p>

<p><b>Perognathus flavescens perniger</b> Osgood. <span class="smcap">Plains Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;This
mouse occurs in northeastern Nebraska. Osgood (1904:127),
in the original description of the subspecies, listed two specimens
from Verdigris [Verdigre], Knox County. Additional records of
occurrence are: Beemer, Cuming County, 2 (USBS); 1-1/2 mi. SE of
Niobrara, Knox County, 3; 1-1/2 mi. S of Pilger, Stanton County, 2.</p>

<p>The two specimens from Beemer are typical <i>perniger</i>. All of the
other Nebraskan specimens are intergrades between <i>P. f. flavescens</i>,
geographically adjacent to the west, and <i>P. f. perniger</i> to the east but
are best referred to <i>perniger</i> on the basis of greater total length,
larger cranial measurements and darker dorsal coloration.</p>

<p><i>P. f. perniger</i> was originally described (Osgood, <i>op. cit.</i>) on the
basis of its darker dorsal coloration and encroachment of the lateral
line on the posterior parts of the venter. The latter character is
not present in all Nebraskan specimens. Mice from the two localities
in Knox County have buffy underparts; those from other
Nebraskan localities do not. Of nine specimens of <i>P. f. perniger</i>
examined from Elk River, Sherburne County, Minnesota, none has
buffy underparts whereas a specimen from Randolph, Fremont
County, Iowa (NSM) does. In addition, in two of five specimens
of <i>P. f. flavescens</i> from Kelso, Hooker County, (MZ) the lateral line
encroaches on the underparts. The encroachment of the lateral line
on the underparts, or failure of the line to do so, is thought to be
only an individual variation and of no taxonomic use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Perognathus flavus piperi</b> Goldman. <span class="smcap">Buffy Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;In
the description of <i>P. f. bunkeri</i>, Cockrum (1951:206) allocated to
the new subspecies, without comment, a specimen from Alliance,
Box Butte County. I have examined this specimen along with all
other Nebraskan specimens known to me and, although all approach
<i>bunkeri</i> in cranial measurements, they seem best referred to <i>piperi</i>
on the basis of darker dorsal coloration and larger external measurements.
Additional records of occurrence, several of them marginal
to the eastward, are: 10 mi. S of Antioch, Garden County, 1 (MZ);
Kelso, Hooker County, 4 (MZ); 5 mi. N of Bridgeport, Morrill
County, 1 (MVZ); 6 mi. N of Mitchell, Scotts Bluff County, 1
(NSM). A specimen not seen by me that was reported from Valentine,
Cherry County (Beed, 1936:21), is presumably also best referred
to <i>P. f. piperi</i>.</p>

<p>No specimens of <i>P. flavus</i> are known to me from south of the
Platte River in southwestern Nebraska although they probably occur
there. If so, they may be referable to <i>P. f. bunkeri</i>, which is found
in counties of Kansas adjoining the southwestern part of Nebraska.</p>

<p><b>Perognathus hispidus paradoxus</b> Merriam. <span class="smcap">Hispid Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;This
subspecies occurs commonly in central-and western-Nebraska.
Eastern marginal records of occurrence are: 2 mi. SE of
Niobrara, Knox County, 1 (NGFPC); 4 mi. E, 2 mi. S of Ord, 1;
Bladen, Webster County, 2 (HM).</p>

<p><b>Perognathus hispidus spilotus</b> Merriam. <span class="smcap">Hispid Pocket Mouse.</span>&mdash;Jones
and Webb (1949:312) first reported this subspecies in Nebraska
as from 5 mi. SE of Rulo, Richardson County. Additional
records of occurrence are: 3 mi. SW of Barnston, Gage County, 1
(NGFPC); Bennet, 1 (NSM), 9 mi. NW of Lincoln, 1 (NSM), 1-1/2
mi. S of Lincoln, 1 (NSM), Lancaster County; Peru, Nemaha
County, 1 (NGFPC); 3 mi. S, 2 mi. E of Nebraska City, Otoe
County, 3; Barada, Richardson County, 1 (NSM); Pleasant Dale,
Seward County, 1 (NSM); 1 mi. S of Williams, Thayer County, 1.</p>

<p>Glass (1947:179) referred a specimen from 9 mi. NW of Lincoln,
Lancaster County, to <i>P. h. paradoxus</i>. In discussing the zone of
intergradation between <i>spilotus</i> and <i>paradoxus</i>, geographically adjacent
to the west, he wrote (<i>op. cit.</i>:178), "It is evident that it proceeds
northeastwards, toward the Missouri River since 2 specimens
from eastern Nebraska, a juvenile from Webster County and an
adult from Lancaster County, are both typical <i>paradoxus</i>." I have
examined the specimen from Webster County referred to by Glass
and agree that it is <i>paradoxus</i>. I have not seen the specimen from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
9 mi. NW of Lincoln; however, another specimen from there, two
others from Lancaster County, and one from Seward County (see
above), are here referred to <i>P. h. spilotus</i>, rather than <i>P. h. paradoxus</i>,
on the basis of notably darker dorsal coloration and smaller
external and cranial measurements. The range of <i>P. h. spilotus</i> in
Nebraska, as presently known, therefore, is limited to the eastern,
more humid part of the State, south of the Platte River.</p>

<p><b>Peromyscus maniculatus osgoodi</b> Mearns. <span class="smcap">Deer Mouse.</span>&mdash;Swenk
(1908:95) reported this subspecies, under the name <i>Peromyscus
nebrascensis</i>, from Glen, and Dice (1941:17) reported the subspecies
from Agate, both localities being in Sioux County in the northwestern
part of the State. Osgood (1909), however, did not mention
Nebraskan specimens of this subspecies and excluded it from the
State on his (<i>op. cit.</i>) distribution map of the subspecies of <i>P.
maniculatus</i>. In addition, Quay (1948:181) reports, as <i>P. m. nebrascensis</i>,
deer mice obtained by him in the badlands of northern
Sioux County and adjacent Niobrara County, Wyoming. Four deer
mice referable to <i>P. m. osgoodi</i> have been obtained from several
localities on the Pine Ridge in Dawes County as follows: 3 mi. E
of Chadron, 2; Chadron State Park, 1; 3 mi. SW of Crawford, 1.
When compared with specimens of <i>P. m. nebrascensis</i>, geographically
adjacent to the east, these mice are seen to be notably darker
and less buffy than <i>nebrascensis</i> and to average significantly larger in
both external and cranial measurements. All deer mice from the
Pine Ridge and adjacent badlands of extreme northwestern Nebraska
probably are best referred to <i>P. m. osgoodi</i>. External measurements
of two adult females are respectively: Total length, 180,
175; length of tail-vertebrae, 78, 74; length of hind foot, 19, 20;
length of ear, 17, 16.</p>

<p><b>Neotoma floridana campestris</b> J. A. Allen. <span class="smcap">Florida Wood Rat.</span>&mdash;Five
wood rats from 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W of Parks, Dundy County, in
extreme southwestern Nebraska, provide the first record of occurrence
of this subspecies in Nebraska. These animals were trapped
in outlying sheds at the Rock Creek State Fish Hatchery. Two
large wood-rat houses were in a dense thicket of brush and young
trees in a small draw on the west side of the most westwardly
hatchery lake. Brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) inhabited a combination
garage-storage barn at the hatchery and no wood rats were
taken there.</p>

<p><b>Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus</b> (Ord). <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania
Meadow Mouse.</span>&mdash;This subspecies occurs in eastern and central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
Nebraska (see Bailey, 1900:18 and Swenk, 1908:104). Additional
records of occurrence are as follows: 5 mi. E of Rising City, Butler
County, 5; 4 mi. SE of Laurel, Cedar County, 1; Wayne, 2, and 2-1/2
mi. E of Wayne, 1, Wayne County; 2-1/2 mi. N of Ord, Valley County, 4.</p>

<p><b>Synaptomys cooperi gossii</b> (Coues). <span class="smcap">Cooper Lemming Mouse.</span>&mdash;Fichter
and Hanson (1947:1-8) reported the first known occurrence
of this microtine in Nebraska, recording specimens from several
localities in Lancaster County and one from near Valentine,
Cherry County. Recent records of this mouse which help to clarify
its distribution in Nebraska are as follows: 4 mi. N, 1/2 mi. E of
Octavia, Butler County, 1; 5 mi. N, 2 mi. W of Parks, Dundy County,
1; 1 mi. N of Pleasant Dale, Seward County, 1.</p>

<p>An adult female from Dundy County provides the westernmost
record of distribution of the species in North America. The animal
was trapped on November 1, 1952, in association with <i>Microtus
pennsylvanicus modestus</i> in a marshy area at the Rock Creek State
Fish Hatchery on spring-fed Rock Creek. The pelage on the back
is notably darker than in <i>S. c. gossii</i>, and resembles <i>S. c. paludis</i>
from the Cimarron River drainage in Meade County, Kansas, but
in the sum total of its characters it most closely resembles <i>S. c.
gossii</i> among named subspecies.</p>

<p><b>Mustela rixosa campestris</b> Jackson. <span class="smcap">Least Weasel.</span>&mdash;The least
weasel occurs in eastern and central Nebraska (see Swenk, 1926:313-330
and Hall, 1951:192) but is known by only a single specimen
from each locality of record save for the area around Inland, Clay
County (Swenk, <i>op. cit.</i>). Additional records of the distribution of
this mustelid in Nebraska are: Hastings, Adams County, 1 (HM);
Schuyler, Colfax County, 1 (NGFPC); Goehner, Seward County, 1
(NSM); 10 mi. S of Ord, Valley County, 1 (NGFPC). The last
mentioned specimen, a skull only, was obtained from a pellet of an
unidentified raptorial bird.</p>
